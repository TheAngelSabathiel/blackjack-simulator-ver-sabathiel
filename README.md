# blackjack-simulator-ver-sabathiel
A Python-based Blackjack game built as a capstone project from Dr. Angela Yuâ€™s Bootcamp. Features include a realistic 52-card deck, deck exhaustion, score tracking, and replay options. Designed to simulate a more strategic casino experience with planned upgrades like betting, soft 17 logic, and GUI.

Hello!

I'm excited to share my first capstone project: Blackjack â€” built using Python (editor: PyCharm) as part of Day 10 of Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp on Udemy.
I followed the course concepts closely but also challenged myself to deliver a more complete (or at least, near-complete) user experience. If you're familiar with the course, youâ€™ll know that the Day 10 solution is typically about 70 lines long with hints provided. I went beyond that to add several new features.

KEY FEATURES I IMPLEMENTED:

ðŸ”§ Realistic deck system: Each card can only appear a maximum of four times (like in a real deck).

ðŸ”§ Deck exhaustion: As more rounds are played, cards are removed from the deck. This adds a layer of strategy where players can use logic and probability to beat the dealer.

ðŸ”§ Deck reset prompt: When the deck is empty, the user is asked whether they want to play with a new deck or exit the program.

ðŸ”§ Score tracking: The game keeps track of the points between the player and the dealer throughout the session.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS I'M CONSIDERING

ðŸš€ Option to view the rules before starting the game.

ðŸš€ Congratulatory messages when the player hits a Blackjack.

ðŸš€ Soft 17 and Hard 17 rules to mimic different casino playstyles.

ðŸš€ Betting system to simulate real-money play.

ðŸš€ Card interface (possibly using ASCII art or a simple GUI) for a more immersive experience.

This program is still a work in progress, and Iâ€™m aware that many lines can be simplified or optimized. But hey â€” Iâ€™ve only been programming for a month, and Iâ€™m incredibly proud of how far Iâ€™ve come.

Feel free to try this out in your Python environment, and Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback or ideas for improvement.

Happy Coding!
